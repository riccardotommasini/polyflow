# Generic Implementations

This module contains some generic implementation of stream processors created with the polyflow APIs.

You can find them in the [shared](src/main/java/org/streamreasoning/polyflow/base) module, which contains some implementations general enough to be used in multiple [examples](https://github.com/riccardotommasini/polyflow-examples/).
