/*
 * This class contains a custom implementation of a Stream To Relation Operator, in particular it's a time-based Tumbling Window.
 * We will give a brief explanation of the various components used by the operator, a more in-depth one can be found in the Official Documentation.
 *
 * Since (for the sake of simplicity) late arrivals are not treated in this example, only one window can be active at each instant in time,
 * represented by the "active_window" object alongside its "active_content": the first represents an interval (opening time and closing time),
 * while the latter represents the content of that window.
 *
 * A window closes (and a new one opens) if an event with timestamp greater than the closing time of the active window arrives.
 * According to this logic, we decide to report the content of a window when it closes (reporting strategy: on window close).
 * Notice how the fact that a window closes can be logically decoupled from the time at which that window is reported to the user: indeed the opening and closing
 * of windows are managed by the Stream To Relation Operator, while the reporting is managed by the Reporting Strategy (report object).
 *
 * Since we use an "On window close" reporting strategy and a tumbling window, the logic will be the following:
 * when a new event arrives and its timestamp is greater than the closing time of the current window, we need to both
 * open a new window and report+close the old one (opening a new window comes from the Tumbling Window logic, while reporting the old one comes
 * from our Reporting Strategy).
 *
 * We achieve this by copying the active_window and the active_content objects into the reported_window and reported_content objects, and assign
 * new instances to the active_window and active_content objects (to represent a newly open window). At this point we add the new event to the fresh
 * active_content, and the operator is ready to report the old window.
 *
 * For the sake of the example, the operator has been simplified a lot (no Ticker o ReportGrain are being used), refer to the official documentation
 * to have more information about advanced features
